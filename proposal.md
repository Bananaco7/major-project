# Proposal TETRIS
I want to create a basic version of tetris with all the base elements which I mention in the "Needs To Have" Section. I am not too sure what 

## Needs To Have
- The basic elements of tetris
- - Falling objects(gravity)
- - Rotation system for the blocks
- - Score counter
- - Combo lines - when a horizontal line is filled clear it
- - Game over 
- Music and sound effects

## Nice To Have
 - Randomized shapes falling with random colors
 - Speed up falling for the blocks
 - Next shape screen
 - START Screen
